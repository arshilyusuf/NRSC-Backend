    "abstract": "This project presents the design and fabrication of a biomimetic Remotely Operated Underwater Vehicle (ROV) inspired by marine life. The primary goal of the project is to develop a functional underwater ROV capable of performing tasks such as surveillance environmental monitoring and exploration. The initial phase of the project involved studying different marine creatures to find a suitable body design that would support the placement of mechanical and electronic components efficiently. After analyzing options like fish dolphin and squid the turtle structure was selected for its simple body profile practical component accommodation and ease of assembly. The actual design phase included detailed three-dimensional modeling which ensured organized placement of motors sensors camera electronics and power supply inside the ROV body. A thorough study of various thruster configurations such as Plus (+) Star T and Parallel was conducted. Based on movement requirements and design simplicity the X-configuration was selected. In this arrangement four motors were positioned symmetrically around the ROV allowing it to move upward downward sideways and rotate by controlling the combination of motor movements. The ROV is operated using a transmitter and receiver communication system. The receiver is positioned above water and connected to the onboard ESP32 microcontroller through a wired link to ensure stable command reception. The system is designed for one-way control communication where the operator sends commands to the ROV but no live data or video feed is transmitted back during underwater operation. To support navigation and monitoring an ultrasonic sensor is mounted externally on the ROV to detect obstacles and a pressure sensor is installed inside the body to monitor internal pressure changes. Both sensor outputs are stored within the ROV’s onboard memory for later retrieval and analysis. Additionally a wireless camera is fixed on the top-mounted camera holder. The camera records underwater footage during the mission and stores the video internally which can be reviewed after the ROV is brought back to the surface. The construction of the ROV involves assembling 3D-printed parts and sealing them using M-Seal and silicone glue ensuring water resistance without using screws or bolts. This approach simplifies the waterproofing process while maintaining structural integrity. The project emphasizes organized internal wiring easy maintenance access through the removable lid and careful placement of all components for efficient operation. This ROV design offers a simple effective solution for underwater tasks where real-time data transmission is not required. Future work will focus on improving system durability refining underwater movement and incorporating more advanced onboard data storage and processing capabilities."
