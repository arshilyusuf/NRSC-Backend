    "abstract": "The report summarizes the research and solution of a problem statement given to me during my internship whose objective was to make use of Artificial Neural network and other Machine learning and deep learning methodology to perform Land use land cover (LULC) classification of a multispectral satellite image into various labels and predict the LULC changes. Hence the approach to the problem was divided into 2 stages first being learning the concept of satellite imagery and techniques used to make the LULC maps and the second was to generate a methodology that could make use of the LULC maps as reference and predict the changes that could be seen in the coming future with an acceptable accuracy specifically using Artificial Neural Network. After thorough research and understanding the basics of remote sensing and the properties of a satellite image along with the different types of data that could be accessible and learning various methods in deep learning and machine learning that could be used to achieve the desire application the objectives were achieved."

    "abstract": "The Ganga basin is the lifeline of millions of people in India hence it becomes important to study the water quality parameters of these river systems and their long term trends. A detailed characterization of water quality parameters is done using Landsat 8 and Sentinel 2 TOA product as TOA was found to be better suited for studies involving reflectance characterization of water bodies. A Pollution Index (NIR – Red) / (NIR + Red) is suggested for studying long term trend of pollution. It has been found that Pollution Index should be avoided in river waters with high turbidity as NIR has shown some sensitivity towards turbidity as well. A Modified Normalized Difference Turbidity Index (MNDTI (B4 – B2) / (B4 + B2)) is suggested as it has shown to have a higher positive correlation with turbidity (r = 0.55) and a higher negative correlation with TDS (r = - 0.41) compared to the traditional NDTI which had r values of 0.51 and - 0.31 with turbidity and TDS respectively. Average visible reflectance is suggested for studying turbidity trends especially in highly polluted waters where the conventional NDTI and the MNDTI have shown errors. Based on the findings the long term trend of Yamuna at Vishramghat Mathura Ganga at Jajmau Kanpur and Hindon at Nagwa UP was carried out. Yamuna at Vishramghat has shown an increase in pollution from 1989 till 2010 and a stable trend from thereon turbidity on the other hand has continuously increased from 1989 till 2019 indicating either an increase in soil erosion or increase in organic sediment load in the river water. The Pollution Index has shown positive values from 2005 onwards with values remaining below 0.05. The Pollution Index value of Ganga at Jajmau Kanpur never showed positive values and has shown a sudden improvement in water quality after 2019 while the turbidity in the river has remained more or less the same in 2021 compared to 1988. Hindon water at Nagwa is highly polluted. In the long term Hindon at Nagwa has shown a deterioration in water quality in terms of both pollution and turbidity compared to 1989. The pollution Index value is as high as 0.34 in 2019."

    "abstract": "Understanding atmospheric lightning flashes and their occurrences is one of the most important aspects of the Earth’s climate science. Real-time lightning data have profound importance in climate science and air-quality research apart from lightning being one of the major natural disasters. Keeping these in view National Remote Sensing Centre (NRSC) Indian Space Research Organization has established a lightning detection sensor (LDS) network for nationwide detection of lightning occurrences with 42 sensors installed until August 2022. Though there is no space borne measurements over India apart from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on the International Space Station (ISS) hereafter referred to as ISS-LIS which detects lightning from space by capturing the optical scattered light emitted from the top of the clouds. The objective of this work is to quantify the similarities and deviations between these two distinct lightning detection technologies by comparing the LDS cloud-to-ground flashes to the ISS-LIS measurements. A full month data collected from these two different instruments during April 2020 is assessed for their efficacies and limitations."

    "abstract": "Airplane Classification is one of the major problem in point object classification from High Resolution satellite imagery. Satellite images are optical and non opti- cal. Feature extraction from satellite image is more feasible with line features like roadrailways and polygon feature like rivers solar farms etc. At the same time point features like boatairplanes are difficult to extract due to less information to noise ration in sample dataset. Simple model will learn less and put lot of bias for point feature extraction whereas complex model will over train and perform poorly for new dataset. Hence careful analysis of sample images has to be per- formed before putting the dataset for training. Conventional machine learning models and cnn based deep learning models have been explored. Dataset has been gathered from Kaggle which is similar to Bhuvan HR data. Labelling has been done and provided in Json format. A classifier is presented as the result of this exercise. This will act as a framework for point feature classification from High Resolution Satellite imagery."
